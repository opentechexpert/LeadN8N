# Workflow: Build Pipeline V1

## Overview

Create a comprehensive and robust build pipeline for Roo Commander releases. This pipeline will be more capable than `WF-CREATE-ROO-CMD-BUILD-V1` and will incorporate steps such as parameter validation, manifest generation (using `[.ruru/scripts/generate-manifest.js](.ruru/scripts/generate-manifest.js)`), artifact packaging, release note generation, and other necessary build operations. The structure should be based on `[.ruru/templates/workflow_structures/01_Basic_Workflow_Structure](.ruru/templates/workflow_structures/01_Basic_Workflow_Structure)`.

## Usage

To use this workflow, initiate it with the required build parameters. It will guide through the necessary steps to produce a release.

## Inputs

*   User request detailing the build parameters (e.g., version, target platforms).

## Outputs

*   Packaged build artifacts.
*   Generated release notes.
*   Build manifest.
