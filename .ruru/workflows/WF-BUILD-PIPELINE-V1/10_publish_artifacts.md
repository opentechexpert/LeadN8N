# Step 10: (Placeholder) Publish Artifacts

## Actions

1.  **Check if Step is Skipped or Placeholder:**
    *   `- [ ]` Determine if this step should be executed or if it's currently just a placeholder. If skipped or placeholder, set `publish_status` to "skipped" or "placeholder_pending_definition" and proceed to `next_step`.
2.  **Define Publishing Strategy (if not placeholder):**
    *   `- [ ]` Identify target repositories, registries, or servers.
    *   `- [ ]` Determine authentication methods and credentials required.
3.  **Upload/Deploy Artifacts (if not placeholder):**
    *   `- [ ]` For each artifact in `artifact_paths`, execute commands or scripts to upload/deploy to the defined targets.
4.  **Verify Publishing (if not placeholder):**
    *   `- [ ]` Check if artifacts are accessible at their new locations.
5.  **Confirm Status:**
    *   `- [ ]` Set `publish_status` based on the outcome.
    *   `- [ ]` Log the publishing attempt and results.

## Acceptance Criteria

*   If executed, build artifacts are successfully published to their designated locations.
*   The `publish_status` output reflects the outcome.

## Error Handling

*   If publishing fails for any artifact, log the error, set `publish_status` to "failed", and proceed to `EE_handle_error.md`.
*   If authentication fails, log the error and proceed to `EE_handle_error.md`.
